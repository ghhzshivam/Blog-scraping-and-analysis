# Web-scraping-data-and-preprocessing-
Their is vast amount of data present in internet and the text data is more than the computervision data. 
In this project I webscraped the blogs from the internet of a specific company and evaluated them using nltk techniches. starting with webscraping and saving the blogs in a folder.
Then in the feature extraction ipynb file I evaluated the blogs based on the words and using the calculation and a specific dictionary given the score to the words to evaluate. 
At last having a table of blogs and their performance based on their words. Like positivity score, negativity score and polarity of the blog and many other things which we should think before writing the text.
Using this we can improve the text.
